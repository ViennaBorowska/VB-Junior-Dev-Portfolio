                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    After graduating from Salford University in 2013 and subsequently building a career in the ethical investment sector of the Finance industry, I am eager to put my skills and energy to good use in an exciting new field!
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    And I really do mean GOOD use: the ethos of an employer of mine was <strong>"Gathering assets to do good"</strong>, and I believe this can be applied in many areas. I am gathering new assets (coding skills) and plan to use them to do good!
                    I am partcularly interested in the areas of machine learning, eliminating bias in AI and increasing accesibility accross the technosphere.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    I try to approach coding like a detective solving a mystery, and that helps to keep me motivated and engaged in my tasks.
                    I am a fast learner with meticulous attention to detail and a creative flair, qualities I think will serve me well in my career ahead.</p>
