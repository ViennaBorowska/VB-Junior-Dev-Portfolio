## DESCRIPTION

This is a project to build a portfolio page showcasing my work as a developer.
I am not happy with the style errors in the page but the functionality is there.
Once I have recieved feedback I anticipate I would like to resubmit the work to fix these styling errors.

I have designed a site with a navigation bar, aside links and main body content.
My initial design was to have 2 columns below the navigation bar, but I think I have just overcomplicated the whole thing for myself, and it would have been easier to have 3 rows underneath but I was too deep in the assignment when I realised this to start over!

## UPDATE 18.12.21

I have rebuilt the site from scratch using Bulma and also incorporating some Javascript. I am now much happier
with the overall layout and style of the page. After originally (misguidedly) using a column and aside, I am now utilising the
grid system via Bulma, which has improved the layout. There is also added responsiveness on the page now, including
a burger menu for handheld devices. I have also added a profile picture and updated the work section with my most recent
projects.

## UPDATE 13.03.22

I have made some adjustments and additions to the site. I have added our 2nd group project to my list of work, along with some of the newer homework projects - both CLI and deployed.
I have updated my LinkedIn profile and included a link to this in the contact section. I have also included a downloadable link to my CV (saved as PDF).
I have improved the responsiveness of the work-cards.

## IMPROVEMENTS

I have improved the style and layout of the page in this update, which was my main focus, but there are further improvements for the future;

- HTML file is big - could create work cards dynamically with JavaScript/Handlebars
- Redesign cards for consistency and responsiveness - maybe hardcode CSS instead of Bulma for more freedom, now my CSS knowledge has improved.
- Contact links could be smaller/more uniform in their style - could utilise FontAwesome for these icons
