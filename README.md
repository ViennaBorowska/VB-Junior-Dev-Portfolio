## TOOLS

## DESCRIPTION
This is a project to build a portfolio page showcasing my work as a developer. 
I am not happy with the style errors in the page but the functionality is there. 
Once I have recieved feedback I anticipate I would like to resubmit the work to fix these styling errors. 

I have designed a site with a navigation bar, aside links and main body content.
My initial design was to have 2 columns below the navigation bar, but I think I have just overcomplicated the whole thing for myself, and it would have been easier to have 3 rows underneath but I was too deep in the assignment when I realised this to start over!  


## UPDATE 18.12.21
I have rebuilt the site from scratch using Bulma and also incorporating some Javascript. I am now much happier
with the overall layout and style of the page. After originally (misguidedly) using a column and aside, I am now utilising the
grid system via Bulma, which has improved the layout. There is also added responsiveness on the page now, including
a burger menu for handheld devices. I have also added a profile picture and updated the work section with my most recent
projects.

## IMPROVEMENTS
I have improved the style and layout of the page in this update, which was my main focus, but there are further improvements for the future;
* HTML file is big - could create work cards dynamically with JavaScript
* Add more elements to page to demonstrate skills and improve UI e.g. some animation
* Include contact link to LinkedIn - profile not yet created

## FILES
* README.md - contact information, file information
* index.html - HTML code
* assets v
1. < style.css = CSS stylesheet
2. < images folder = all images linked in code
